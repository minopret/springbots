"""
This package contains modules to describe the Springbot creature.
Composed with springs and nodes. It implements the 2D physics behind the
simulations steps of springbot's structure, the Springbot class itself and
functions to load and dump xml files from springbots objects.
It also contains modules which extends the Springbot class
in order to provide evolving features and networking distribution,
also it has a module which implements a genetic algorithm both local
and network distributed to evolve Springbot for specific fitness functions
implemented in the 'fitness' module like 'walk', 'swim' and 'jump'
