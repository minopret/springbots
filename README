*** Springbots ***

Written by Rodrigo Setti - rodrigosetti@gmail.com

Springbot is a genetic algorithm experiment in which physical simulated 2d
creatures built with nodes and springs(like sodaplay) are evolved for
walk, swim, jump or whatever fitness function the user might write.
After several simulations it is possible for one to see animal-like behaviors
optimizing for the desired fitness.

*** Requirements ***

* Python >= 2.5
* python-qt4
* xmlrpclib-python
* pygame

*** Programs ***

* evolve.py -	Take an population described in a xml file and evolve them for
				a specific fitness function chosen.

* net-evolve.py	-	Same like evolve.py but connect to a set of servers listed in
					fitness-servers.txt to do the processing.

* imagebot.py -	Transform a xml springbot description into a svg image.

* randombot.py -	Generate a random springbot population xml file, useful for a
					starting seed for simulations.

* viewer.py -	Real time graphics of the springbot being simulated(the evolve
				programs also have an option for that).
